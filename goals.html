    I am looking forward to becoming a fully qualified web developer and collaborating during my time at gSchool. Afterward, I would like to find a position either in SF or in Seattle. I am more attracted to a smaller company where I can continue to learn a variety of different things and skills to add to my toolbelt. I also would like to find a position where I am forwarding some form of social service. Eventually I would like to find a remote position so that I am more free to travel. I have been through much of Europe and look forward to exploring other parts of the world!
